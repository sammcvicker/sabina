        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Greetings from Little Africa</em> is a multimedia project which maps the history and impact of Downtown Manhattan’s Black Visual arts scene during the Black Arts Movement (1969-74). Downtown, widely known as the main stomping ground in the development of modern and contemporary art, was also a significant destination for Black creativity in the 20th century. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Greetings</em> explores the overlooked narrative about the work done by Black artists in the Village. It seeks to make known the diversity of Black creative practices, and their influence on the contemporary art world. I hope the project will resonate with the diverse community that lives, works, visits, and attends school in the Village.

        <h2>Meaning of <em>Greetings from Little Africa</em></h2>
        <p>
          The project’s name comes from Lower Manhattan’s origins as a place for Black landowners during the 17th century, later becoming known as a neighborhood for freed slaves during the 19th century – the city’s “Little Africa.” During the Great Migration in the early 20th century, this population had moved uptown to Harlem. Using the term to refer to the neighborhood in modern times honors the history and presence of Black communities in the area who have gone unnoticed in mainstream historical narratives.

          The Artist
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sabina Paellmann is a multidisciplinary artist and curator based in New York City. She started this project as a Black multidisciplinary artist living Downtown. The project's research began in 2021, during their undergraduate study at Parsons, where she initially explored prominent Black creatives in the area. This focus narrowed during her graduate study at NYU to specifically address figures and places involved in visual arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate goal of the project is to delve into the history of artists like themselves and to share these findings with others. Additionally, they aim to inspire their academic and art world peers who may be less familiar with the significant contributions of Black artists and administrators Downtown.

          This project is as much a design project as it is a research project. I’d like to give a special thanks to <a href="https://sammcvicker.com">Sam McVicker</a>, the designer who worked with me to build the site.
